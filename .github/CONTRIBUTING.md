# Contributing

Thank you for wanting to contribute to the BrackeysBot project! Before you start, please take a quick look at the guidelines we set for contributors, to ensure a smooth collaboration!

1. [Issues](#issues)
2. [Pull Requests](#pull-requests)
3. [Coding Styles](#coding-styles)

## Issues

If you want to suggest _enhancements_ or report _bugs_, please open an issue! We try to give each issue to individual attention it deserves, but still - be patient until we get to yours!

We created a few issue templates (for example for features requests or bug reports), which you are intended to use. If the type of issue you want to create doesn't fit a template, feel free to create an issue from scratch, but still include sufficient information for us to understand it.

At this time issues will persist forever - in the future we might close issues after a certain amount of inactivity.

## Pull Requests

If you worked on a new feature or fixed an open issue, please create a **pull request** so we can merge your work into ours.

If it is not immediately apparent which feature you added or which issue you addressed, please include an adequate description in your pull request. If you still need to work on the pull request before it can be merged please open it as a _draft_.

Note that if you do successfully terminate an issue, include `Closes #issue-id` in your commit message so the issue is automatically referenced.

Also do note that we try to enforce consistent coding styles among the repository, which we explain in the section [coding styles](#coding-styles). We review every pull request, and we would appreciate it if you would accept the changes that we propose during our reviews.

## Coding Styles

In general we follow the standard [Microsoft C# naming conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/general-naming-conventions). If you want insights to individual variable naming conventions, please refer to the existing code in the repository.
